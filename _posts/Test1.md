Is this working?

I am giving this a good go. How does it produce the **<u>markdown</u>**? How do I create a bulleted list in this app. An example follows:

- This is the first item in the list
- This is the next item in the list
- This is the third item in the list

Ok, I am going to complete this document and go from here.
